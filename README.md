Lupan's config files
====================

To reproduce my environment clone this repo into `~/dotfiles` and run

```
$ stow -v alacritty bspwm music shell tmux
```

if you want i3 instead of bspwm (left as a fallback) *also* run

```
$ stow -v i3
```

Watch this video for a demo of using `stow` to manage dotfiles:
